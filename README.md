# Java 2D Mini Game
A short, dungeon-based minigame that utilises the concepts found in object-oriented programming.
The aim of this project was to create a running game, applying the common programming concepts found in object-oriented programming (written in Java), 
and to create a simple GUI for the player to interact with different components of the game.
